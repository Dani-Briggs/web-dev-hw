How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?
  <head> has 5 main elements and <body> has multiple elements within structural and semantic markup. The <head> elements are for the coders eyes whereas the <body> elements are for anyone who uses the website. The <body> elements hold everything thats going to be shown and The <head> elements allow them to be shown.

Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.
  Structural is the basic strucure of the information of the markup; Headings, Paragraphs, Breaks, and Lists. Semantic is used to reinforce the information within the markup, using bolds, italics and more.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
  The first thing I did was get a recipe. I chose Pizza because I like pizza. From then on, I went through the steps on moodle for the assignment. There weren't any hiccups, except that my picture won't show up. I had the same problem for the last assignment too.
