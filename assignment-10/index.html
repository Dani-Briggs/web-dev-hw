              You don't know what it's like to live in shadows<br>
              Always regretting what you've done<br>
              Spending time counting every little mistake<br>
              Knowing it's always easier to run<br>
              <br>
              [Sun]<br>
              You don't have to spend your life looking backwards<br>
              We've been through this over and over again<br>
              You can't just wish it away<br>
              The past is the past it will never change<br>
              That was before, this is now<br>
              And when we have a chance to make it better if we try<br>
              <br>
              [Blake]<br>
              Oh, but I will not endanger one more friend<br>
              <br>
              [Sun]<br>
              You're free to do the things you want<br>
              But listen, so am I<br>
              <br>
              [Blake]<br>
              I made my choice<br>
              <br>
              [Sun]<br>
              And now I'm making mine<br>
              <br>
              [Both]<br>
              Go where you need to<br>
              Know I won't leave you<br>
              I'll follow you like morning follows night<br>
              You can run till your pain's through<br>
              One thing I won't do<br>
              Is to let you go alone to face the fight!<br>
              <br>
              [Blake]<br>
              Hard to know where to turn when your life's a disaster<br>
              Trying to start all over again<br>
              So much shame, so much time that just feels wasted<br>
              Feeling like now could never make up for then<br>
              <br>
              [Sun]<br>
              Life's not a game you can play to get even<br>
              We all make mistakes, but we need to move on<br>
              I know that you hate where you strayed<br>
              Forgiving yourself is the only way<br>
              Just look ahead, yesterday is gone<br>
              I know you think you're being selfless, but you're not<br>
              <br>
              [Blake]<br>
              I refuse to risk another's pain again<br>
              <br>
              [Sun]<br>
              The pain is when you shut me out<br>
              Take off on your own<br>
              No matter what<br>
              You'll never walk alone<br>
              <br>
              [Both]<br>
              Go where you need to<br>
              Know I won't leave you<br>
              I'll follow you like morning follows night<br>
              You can run till your pain's through<br>
              One thing I won't do<br>
              Is to let you go alone to face the fight<br>
              <br>
              [Sun]<br>
              See you'll never understand what I feel, what I see<br>
              What's going through my mind, how it feels being me<br>
              All the struggles, all the fights, long days, longer nights<br>
              Trying to search for this happiness lost in the light<br>
              But it seems that it's all just out of my sight<br>
              Just out of my reach, can't seem to get right<br>
              Like I'm cursed with the turbulence placed in my life<br>
              Can't push or pull it, stuck up in this ball pit<br>
              Cycle of pain, all the stress in my brain<br>
              I'm just trying to maintain, cause I'm going insane<br>
              But no matter what I do, the cries go unheard<br>
              Yet I still believe in you, every breath, every word<br>
              Every smile, every glance could be another chance<br>
              That you find to see the love that is me<br>
              So until that time, I'll follow everyday<br>
              Every step of the way, and continue to say<br>
              <br>
              [Both]<br>
              Go where you need to<br>
              Know I won't leave you<br>
              I'll follow you like morning follows night<br>
              You can run till your pain's through<br>
              One thing I won't do<br>
              Is to let you go alone to face the fight<br> </div>
