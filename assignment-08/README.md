# Assignment 8
## Dani Briggs

Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

It wasn't to hard since I was in creative coding and web tech before this class. I did feel a little tedious at times.

Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I'm always anxious about classes. They hardly worked for me in my other coding classes.

I got all the martials that I needed for the assignment, like the images. I then followed the steps on moodle. After that I got started on the readme.
