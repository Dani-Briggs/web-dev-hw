Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?

I've seen mulitple forms on websites that I've been on. They're mostly for information regarding Contact info. For example, a text box to put your email in for a mailing list. It creates a space on your website to collect information.

List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.

Passwords, Usernames, Emails, Mulitple Choice Test, Setting Dates. Any of those could be used in a School, Business, or Store website.
