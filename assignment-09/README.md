Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

Universal means it will apply to everything. Element means it will only apply to a certain element
like a header or paragraph element. Class means that it will only apply to elements with that class tag. The id selector is for elements with a certain id with the # symbol. You might want to use most of the other selectors over the universal one if you want a lot of varity on your website.


Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

I chose the 90s so, my color palette is a red flannel shirt. red, black, grey(more transparent black). rgb(135,29,29), rgb(0,0,0), rgb(129, 134, 138). #871d1d, 	#000000, #81868a

First I went through the color module on the web design website. I did some research on 90s design trends. Then I got my pictures and colors. After that I went through the steps of the assignment and did the readme.
